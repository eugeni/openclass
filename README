OpenClass is a simple open-source solution for class control, designed with the
following features in mind:
 - small footprint
 - light-weight functionality
 - minimum of non-essential features

If you already know how italc, bluelab, mythware, iClass and similar solutions
work, you already know what OpenClass is. If you do not, here is some
introduction.

Introduction
------------

OpenClass is a small class control solution, which helps teacher to control his
activities in the classroom. Among such activities, the most commonly used are:

(From teacher to student)
 - screen projection (send content of teacher screen to all the students) in
   different resolutions and bandwidth usage modes
 - full-screen resolution-independent screen projection
 - student attention request (blocking student activities and asking them to
   look at teacher)
 - viewing contents of all students screens at once
 - direct messaging to students
 - share a student screen with other students
 - file sharing and URL sharing to enrich class activities
 - shutting down student computers from teacher
 - allow and reject students from a specific class
 - allow to block students from attempting to connect to a class
 - support for multi-seat configurations and multiple clients per machine (for
   example, xdmcp-based environments)

(From student to teacher)
 - automatic teacher discovery via broadcast
 - receiving of teacher screen projection via multicasting protocol, suitable
   for both wired and wireless environments
 - "raise hand" functionality to call teacher attention
 - possibility to select teacher to connect to
 - automatic handling of network saturation and disconnection events

(Misc)

 - support for Linux and Windows-based operating systems
 - possibility to have multiple teachers and classes on same network/vlan
 - multicast throttling to avoid saturating the network
 - support for customization by means of skins/plugins
